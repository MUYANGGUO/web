title: "On Identifying Disaster Tweets using LSTM with Glove, and BERT with meta-feature"
date: 2020-04-21
excerpt: "In this paper, we proposed a new method on identifying disaster tweets by combining BERT and
meta-feature into a simple neural network to train a classification
model and fine-tune the model. Our result shows that BERT with
meta-feature can achieve an F1 score of 0.83231 on identifying
disaster tweets."
