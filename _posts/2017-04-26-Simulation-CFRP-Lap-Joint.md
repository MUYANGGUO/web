title: "Simulation of tensile test on
CFRP lap joint"
date: 2017-04-26
excerpt: "Developed an finite element approach that performs the tensile
test of the adhesive bonded CFRP materials numerically using FEA method, achieved a general understanding of failure conditions at bonded
region under tension loads, and real cause of failure, investigated the response of tested part with respect to different material compositions and various defects in bond line"
