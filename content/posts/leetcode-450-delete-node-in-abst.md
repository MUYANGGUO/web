### 450. Delete Node In ABST — Medium

[Open on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-abst/)

## Problem

450. Delete Node in a BST -- Medium

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Follow up: Can you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?


Example 1:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.

Example 3:
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
 

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
Each node has a unique value.
root is a valid binary search tree.
-105 <= key <= 105

## Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: TreeNode, key: int) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return
        if key > root.val:
            root.right = self.deleteNode(root.right, key)
        elif key < root.val:
            root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, key)
        # now the key is the root of a subtree
        else:

            if not root.left:
                return root.right
            # if it has a left child, we want to find the max val on the left subtree to 
            # replace the node we want to delete.
            else:
                # try to find the max value on the left subtree
                tmp = root.left
                while tmp.right:
                    tmp = tmp.right
                # replace
                root.val = tmp.val
                root.left = self.deleteNode(root.left, tmp.val)
        return root
```
